# A persistent volume claim (PVC) specifies the desired access mode and storage capacity. 
# Currently, based on only these two attributes, a PVC is bound to a single PV. Once a PV 
# is bound to a PVC, that PV is essentially tied to the PVCâ€™s project and cannot be bound 
# to by another PVC. There is a one-to-one mapping of PVs and PVCs. 
# However, multiple pods in the same project can use the same PVC.
